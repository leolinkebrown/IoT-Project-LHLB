# IoT-Project-LHLB



## General Information

This full-stack Node.JS application is used to monitor the sound levels around you using an ESP32 and sound sensor. Through a webpage, a graph is shown which tracks the decibel count that the sound sensor receives from the ESP32. This can be useful for tracking the level of sound around you for people who are hard of hearing or to determine if people need hearing protection in an area due to the loudness.
